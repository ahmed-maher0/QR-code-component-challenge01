## Overview

This is my first HTML & CSS project, and I coded it entirely on my own. It was a really satisfying experience because I learned several awesome skills—like how to translate a Figma design into clean code, how to use browser DevTools effectively for debugging, and many other small but exciting techniques that improved my workflow.

## My process

I started by reviewing the Figma design and identifying the main layout structure. From there, I wrote the HTML using simple, semantic elements, then styled the component with CSS. I used Flexbox to center the card, set up spacing and typography based on the design, and refined everything using browser DevTools. I made small adjustments along the way until the component matched the design as closely as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge helped strengthen my HTML and CSS fundamentals. I learned how to translate a Figma design into code, structure semantic HTML, and center elements with Flexbox. I also got more comfortable using CSS variables, debugging with DevTools, and writing cleaner, more organized CSS.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to keep improving my CSS layout skills (Flexbox and Grid), get better at building fully responsive designs, and write cleaner, more maintainable CSS. I also plan to sharpen my design sense and continue using DevTools more efficiently as I take on more Frontend Mentor challenges.
